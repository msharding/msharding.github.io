        <p>Daycare</p>
        <p>Doggie day cares are needed because dogs are social, pack animals. They thrive best when they have constant interaction with other dogs. Two well-known phrases hold true: A bored dog is a destructive dog, and A tired dog is a happy dog. What could be better than knowing while you’re at work, your special pup is having the time of their life awith all their four-legged friends?</p><br><br>
        <p>Grooming</p>
        <p>Our Dog Spa uses the finest, ph-balanced grooming products available in the industry that are safe for both your pet and the environment.  Our groomers are skilled professionals that understand the particular needs of different breeds. We will analyze the condition of your pet’s skin, coat, eyes, ears and teeth. As a result, we can alert you to symptoms of common medical problems so you can consult with your vet early on.</p><br>

		<p>We offer a variety of grooming packages that we can customize to you and your dog's needs. Early drop off and late pick-up are available. Call us today at 847.636.2115 to schedule your appointment! Get your pooch pampered today!</p><br><br>

		<p>Boarding</p>
        <p>We know how worrisome it can be to leave your canine kid with someone else. That's why we go the extra mile to ensure your pet has a fabulous time while staying with us. This is nothing like "traditional boarding" where your pet is locked in a small cage all day and night with an occasional 15-minute exercise break. Your pet will spend most of their day playing with the day care dogs. Overnight guests are only up in their rooms during nap time, feedings and overnight. Breakfast and dinner are included in the cost of any overnight stay, and we will be happy to distribute any necessary medications at your request. We strongly suggest you provide your dog’s regular food to avoid any upset stomachs.</p>
