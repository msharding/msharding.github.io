          <h2>See What We Mean. Dog Daycare.</h2>
          <p>Nessie & Fife Co. is a new and exciting doggie day care facility located in downtown Palatine! Our 4,000 sq. ft. indoor play area is outfitted with playground equipment, balls and other toys to stimulate activity for our doggie tenants. Our outdoor play area is nearly 3,000 sq. ft., a great treat for your dog to be able to bask in the sunshine (when weather permits, of course!).<br><br>

We are committed to providing peace of mind to dog owners with our experience, devoted care, safety, cleanliness and endless love for your pets. Rather than keeping your pup cooped up all day, contact a B&B pet professional to learn about how we can get your pet healthy and happy through socialization and exercise.<br><br>

In addition to day care, we also offer a full-service grooming dog spa, boarding and numerous training programs. Call for more information, or better yet, stop by for a tour!</p><br>
